# How to use?

  1. `go build -o checker .`
  2. `./checker $SHOP_ID $ORDER_ID`

Both numbers can be found on the receipt you get from your shop.

# Purpose?

I was bored to fill out the form of the website to check the status of my glasses.

# Missing features

  1. The program does not handle the retrieval of positive order information because I have not yet been supplied with html that represents a successful order but only with html representing a pending order.
  2. Handling the status of ONLINE orders.
